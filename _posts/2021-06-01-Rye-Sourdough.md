title: Sourdough With Rye Flour
author: Matthew Schupack

This was a really fun one. I tried a higher hydration (80% vs 75% on all my previous bakes), and also tried adding a little bit of rye flour in addition to the normal whole-wheat/white flour blend. The higher hydration dough was a bit harder to work with, but not too bad, and the rye gave the finished loaf a really great depth of flavor. Overall this is probably the tastiest and most attractive loaf I've baked so far.
