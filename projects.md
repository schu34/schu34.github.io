### Chip-8 emulator | May 2020

I wanted to learn more about emulators, and I'd been meaning to play around with rust for a while, so I decided to implement a chip-8 emulator in rust. It's not 100% polished, but it can play games and demos fairly well.

### Tuneweb | January 2017

I made Tuneweb to help me find new music to listen to. It uses [d3](https://d3js.org/) and the [last.fm api](http://www.last.fm/api) to visualize neighborhoods of similar artists. Users can type the name of an artist, and see a graph that shows artists related to the one they typed in, as well as artists related to those artists.

### lobbyboxer.com | December 2015 - February 2016

Website for local St. Louis band Lobby Boxer. This was my first every web-dev project, and I taught myself JS, html and css as I went. I designed and built all parts of the site. It features a responsive design, automatic fetching of photos using the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) and an audio player using the [Web Audio API ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
