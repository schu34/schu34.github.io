### Tuneweb | January 2017 - present

I made Tuneweb to help me find new music to listen to. It uses [d3](https://d3js.org/) and the [last.fm api](http://www.last.fm/api) to visualize neighborhoods of similar artists.

### lobbyboxer.com | December 2015 - February 2016

Website for local St. Louis band Lobby Boxer. I designed and coded all parts of the site. It features a responsive design, automatic fetching of photos using the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) and an audio player using the [Web Audio API ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
