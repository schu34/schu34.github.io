### Tuneweb - December 2016

I made Tuneweb to help me find new music to listen to. It uses [d3](https://d3js.org/) and the [last.fm api](http://www.last.fm/api) to visualize neighborhoods of similar artists.

### lobbyboxer.com

Website for local St. Louis band Lobby Boxer. I designed and coded all parts of the site. It features a responsive design, automatic fetching of photo using the [Facebook Graph API]() and an audio player using the [Web Audio API]().
